DELIVERABLES
Common Deliverables:
	UI Elements reflecting in game information ✅
		- points, health, attack type, and damage on the UI
	Functioning Entity System ✅
		- Entities can be spawned, damaged, and die (freed)
	Basic Collision Detection ** ✅
		- collision with all 4 walls and ceiling and floor
		- some collision on center box but still pretty glitchy
	Basic User Controls ✅
		- player can move with WASD like a normal game
		- player can sprint when going forward
		- player can jump
	A contained game world ✅
		- can't leave the starting box
Personal Deliverables:
	variety of 10 enemy types ✅
		- 10 different monster types, mostly models I found that were funny or had the right files online
		- 5 don't move yet
		- 5 move towards wherever the player is and stop at collision with both bounding boxes
		- charmander, kong, porygon, skelleton, mario, yoshi, creeper, finn, goomba, arlo
	5 player mechanics to defend against the waves ✅
		- the player has 5 different attacks they can use which do different damage
		- can only attack the entities that were manually spawned in
		- still have to figure out how to raycast from the player to select an entity to damage
		- attacks: fire, ice, bullet, magic, melee
	5 defensive structures that can be built ✅
		- 2 walls and 3 turrets can be built
		- small wood fence and brick wall
		- big bullet turret
		- big fire turret
		- small bullet turret
		- monsters will get stuck behind the walls and stop chasing the players
		- I want to implement that they can do damage and destroy the walls but I have to figure out how to pass the wall entity to the one doing damage.
		- Bug: If another wall gets placed they will ignore the first wall and only act as if the second one exists
	3 levels of upgrade for the structures ✅
		- 3 Levels of upgrade (T1, T2, T3, and Base)
		- upgrading the walls gives them more health
		- upgrading the turrets gives more health and more damage
		- T1: green highlight
		- T2: blue highlight
		- T3: red highlight
		- Base: white highlight (default starting state)
	5 strengths for the monsters (ex: one has armor and takes less bullet damage) ✅
		- 5 of the monsters are resistent to 1 type of attack
		- Yoshi: fire
		- Creeper: melee
		- Finn: ice
		- Goomba: magic
		- Arlo: bullet
